A new Bullet class is used and collision detection introduced so that bullets (yellow rectangles) fired up the window can hit a Mob (red rectangle) and destroy it.
The bullet is also destroyed. In reality the Mob is simply reset to the top of the window.

A rectangle collider function is used rather than the Pygame built-in collision detection.
