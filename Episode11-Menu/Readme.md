The game now starts on a Menu screen. You can turn the background music on and off, toggle Debug mode, and press Enter to start.
When you die, the game returns to the Menu, ready to go again. The state-machine principle is used to control what happens between menu-play-quit states.
The code has been re-factored to ensure maximum compatability with all three game libraries.
