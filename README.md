# Shmup_With_Pygame_Love2D_Monogame
Comparing and contrasting a simple shoot-em-up with Python + Pygame, Lua + Love2D and C# + Monogamee

This repository is based on the Shmup! game written in Python and Pygame on the Youtube channel KidsCanCode starting with the first part at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGufy7weyGY

The code has been extensively re-factored to make it as close to the methods used in Love2D and Monogame as possible.
It is a useful learning tool for those starting with game development, and unsure which framework to use.

There is now a playlist on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE8GQEkUWuwGPi2WDiiQihG5nIZMecLHP

The sounds folder cotains sound effects that have either been created with https://www.bfxr.net/, or found on opengameart
The background music is available from https://opengameart.org/content/frozen-jam-seamless-loop

The explosions folder contains art attributed to Kenney, on opengameart.org, but no longer available.
