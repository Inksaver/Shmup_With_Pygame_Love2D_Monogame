# Shmup_With_Pygame_Love2D_Monogame
Comparing and contrasting a simple shoot-em-up with Python + Pygame, Lua + Love2D and C# + Monogamee

This repository is based on the Shmup! game written in Python and Pygame on the Youtube channel KidsCanCode starting with the first part at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGufy7weyGY

The code has been extensively re-factored to make it as close to the methods used in Love2D and Monogame as possible.
It is a useful learning tool for those starting with game development, and unsure which framework to use.
There will be a series of Youtube videos posted shortly.
